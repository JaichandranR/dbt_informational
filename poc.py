Step 1: Extract and Process Metadata from manifest.json
Parse manifest.json:

Load the manifest.json file into your script (using Python, for example).
Extract key pieces of metadata for each model, such as:
Model name
Descriptions (for models, columns, etc.)
Tags
Dependencies
Any relevant metadata fields that might help in search queries
python
Copy code
import json

with open('path/to/manifest.json') as file:
    manifest = json.load(file)

models_metadata = []
for model in manifest['nodes'].values():
    if model['resource_type'] == 'model':
        models_metadata.append({
            'name': model['name'],
            'description': model.get('description', ''),
            'tags': model.get('tags', []),
            'columns': {col: data.get('description', '') for col, data in model.get('columns', {}).items()},
            'dependencies': model.get('depends_on', {}).get('nodes', [])
        })
Prepare Data for Embedding:

For each model, create a combined text representation from its description, tags, column descriptions, and any other relevant fields.
This combined text will be used to create embeddings, which are vector representations of the model metadata that capture the semantic meaning.
python
Copy code
documents = [
    f"{model['name']} {model['description']} {' '.join(model['tags'])} {' '.join(model['columns'].values())}"
    for model in models_metadata
]
Step 2: Generate Embeddings for Semantic Search
Choose an Embedding Model:

Use a language model to convert the combined text representations into embeddings. Popular choices include OpenAI’s models, Hugging Face models, or open-source embeddings like sentence-transformers.
Here’s an example using sentence-transformers:
python
Copy code
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
embeddings = model.encode(documents)
Store Embeddings in a Vector Database:

Choose a vector database like Pinecone, Weaviate, or Redis with vector search capabilities to store the embeddings.
Each entry should include the embedding along with relevant metadata (e.g., model name and ID), so you can retrieve the right model based on similarity.
python
Copy code
import pinecone

pinecone.init(api_key='your-api-key', environment='your-environment')
index = pinecone.Index("dbt-models-index")

for i, model in enumerate(models_metadata):
    index.upsert([
        (model['name'], embeddings[i].tolist(), {"description": model['description']})
    ])
Step 3: Implement Semantic Search
Accept User Queries:

Take a natural language query from the user.
Convert Query to Embedding:

Use the same embedding model to convert the query into an embedding vector.
python
Copy code
query = "monthly sales trends"
query_embedding = model.encode(query)
Search the Vector Database:

Perform a similarity search in the vector database to find the most relevant models.
python
Copy code
results = index.query(query_embedding.tolist(), top_k=5, include_metadata=True)
for result in results['matches']:
    print(f"Model: {result['id']}, Description: {result['metadata']['description']}")
Step 4: Display and Refine Results
Present the top results to the user, showing details like the model name, description, and any other helpful metadata.
Allow users to refine or filter the results based on additional criteria (e.g., tags or dependencies).
Optional: Enrich Results with Text-to-SQL Generation
After finding relevant models, you can enhance the workflow by integrating a text-to-SQL generator.
With the information from manifest.json (e.g., table names and columns), a text-to-SQL model (e.g., via LangChain or a custom setup) could generate queries based on user intent and retrieved metadata.
Summary
By following these steps, you’ll have a system where users can enter natural language queries and retrieve the most semantically relevant DBT models based on metadata from manifest.json. This approach makes it easier to discover and understand the purpose of DBT models without manual browsing. Let me know if you need more detail on any step!
