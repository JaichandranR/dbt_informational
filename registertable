POC Summary: Registering Tables in Trino
Objective
This POC aims to explore and validate the process of registering tables within the Trino environment, focusing on setup, access control, and best practices. By the end, we should have a clear, repeatable approach for registering and managing tables efficiently across catalogs and schemas.

Goals
Evaluate Registration Workflow: Test and document the steps for registering tables within specific catalogs and schemas in Trino.
Access Control Configuration: Define and validate the use of access control rules, including schema and table-level permissions.
Wildcard and Regex Matching: Test the use of wildcards and regex in table registration to support dynamic access management.
Documentation of Best Practices: Summarize best practices for seamless table registration and management.
Key Components
Catalogs and Schemas:

Verify the correct setup and organization of catalogs and schemas in Trino.
Test configurations for specific schema patterns (e.g., ^.+_dev_[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,25}$) to ensure they meet business and security requirements.
Table Naming and Patterns:

Establish a consistent naming convention for tables to facilitate dynamic access management.
Test patterns such as .*_sharedteam2$ for table registration and access control, validating regex behavior.
Access Control Rules:

Implement access control using Trinoâ€™s file-based security configurations.
Test and validate privileges for specific user groups, schemas, and tables using patterns and regular expressions.
Examples of patterns tested:
Schema pattern: ^team1_share_prototype$
Table pattern: .*_sharedteam2$ (tables ending with _sharedteam2)
Testing and Validation:

Document the steps and results of tests for each configuration scenario.
Note any limitations or caveats encountered, such as unsupported wildcard behavior or specific requirements for regex syntax.
Best Practices:

Use descriptive table names that align with access control rules.
Limit regex usage in table patterns for simplicity and performance.
Regularly review and update access control configurations to align with organizational changes.
Outcomes and Next Steps
Documentation: A fully documented process for table registration in Trino, including examples of working configurations.
Recommendations: Guidance on naming conventions, schema organization, and access management.
Future Work: Explore integration with additional tools for automated table registration and access management.
